## TL;DR

Trinity is an experimental bot framework written in Rust and using matrix-rust-sdk, as well as
commands / modules compiled to WebAssembly, with convenient developer features like modules
hot-reload.

## What is this?

This started as a fun weekend project where I've written a new generic Matrix bot framework. It is
written in Rust from scratch using the fantastic
[matrix-rust-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) crate.

Bot commands can be implemented as WebAssembly components, using
[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) as the WebAssembly virtual machine, and
[wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) for conveniently implementing
interfaces between the host and wasm modules.

See for instance the [`uuid`](https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/blob/main/modules/uuid/src/lib.rs)
and [`horsejs`](https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/blob/main/modules/horsejs/src/lib.rs) modules.

Make sure to install the required tools (as of this writing, `wit-bindgen` and `wasm-tools`)
to be able to build wasm components. We're using a pinned revision of this that can automatically
be installed with `./modules/install-tools.sh` at the moment; we hope to lift that
limitation in the future.

Modules can be hot-reloaded, making it trivial to deploy new modules, or replace existing modules
already running on a server. It is also nice during development iterations on modules. Basically
one can do the following to see changes in close to real-time:

- run trinity with `cargo run`
- `cd modules/ && cargo watch -x "component build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --release"` in another terminal 

The overall generic design is inspired from my previous bot,
[botzilla](https://github.com/bnjbvr/botzilla), that was written in JavaScript and was very
specialized for Mozilla needs.

## Want / "roadmap"

At this point I expect this to be more of a weekend project, so I won't commit to any of those, but
here's my ideas of things to implement in the future. If you feel like implementing some of these
ideas, please go ahead :)

### Core features

- fetch and cache user names
- make it possible to answer privately / to the full room / as a reply to the original message / as
  a thread reply.
- add ability to set emojis on specific messages (? this was useful for the admin module in botzilla)
- moonshot: JS host so one can test the chat modules on a Web browser, without requiring a matrix
  account
    - marsshot: existing modules built from CI and pushed to a simple Web app on github-pages that
      allows selecting an individual module and trying it.
- seek other `TODO` in code :p

### Modules

- post on twitter. Example: `!tweet Inflammatory take that will receive millions of likes and quote-tweets`
    - same requirements as mastodon, likely
- gitlab auto-link to issues/merge requests: e.g. if someone types `!123`, post a link to
  `https://{GITLAB_REPO_URL}/-/issues/123`.
    - would require the room to be configured with a gitlab repository
    - same for github would be sweet
- ask what's the weather in some city, is it going to rain in the next hour, etc.

## Deploying

### Docker

If you want, you can use the image published on Docker
([bnjbvr/trinity](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bnjbvr/trinity)) -- it might be lagging
behind by a few commits -- or build the Docker image yourself:

```
docker build -t bnjbvr/trinity .
```

Then start it with the right environment variables (see also `.env.example`):

```
docker run -e HOMESERVER="matrix.example.com" \
    -e BOT_USER_ID="@trinity:example.com" \
    -e BOT_PWD="hunter2" \
    -e ADMIN_USER_ID="@admin:example.com" \
    -v /host/path/to/data/directory:/opt/trinity/data \
    -ti bnjbvr/trinity
```

Data is saved in the `/opt/trinity/data` directory, and it is recommended to make it a volume so as
to be able to decrypt messages over multiple sessions and so on.

### Custom Modules

If you want, you can specify a custom modules directory using the `MODULES_PATHS` environment
variable and adding another data volume for it. This can be useful for hacking modules only without
having to compile the host runtime. Here's an example using Docker:

```
docker run -e HOMESERVER="matrix.example.com" \
    -e BOT_USER_ID="@trinity:example.com" \
    -e BOT_PWD="hunter2" \
    -e ADMIN_USER_ID="@admin:example.com" \
    -e MODULES_PATH="/wasm-modules" \
    -v /host/path/to/data/directory:/opt/trinity/data \
    -v /host/path/to/modules:/wasm-modules \
    -ti bnjbvr/trinity
```

### Configuration

Trinity can be configured via config file. The config file can be passed in from the command line:

```bash
cargo run -- config.toml
```

Or it can be placed in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, typically `~/.config/trinity/config.toml` on XDG
compliant systems. Configuration lives in the document root, for example:

```toml
home_server = "matrix.example.com"
user_id = "@trinity:example.com"
password = "hunter2"
matrix_store_path = "/path/to/store"
redb_path = "/path/to/redb"
admin_user_id = "@admin:example.com"
modules_path = ["/wasm-modules"]
```

### Module Configuration

It's also possible to pass arbitrary configuration down to specific modules in the config
file. For example:

```toml
[modules_config.pun]
format = "image"
```

This passes the object `{"format": "image"}` to the `pun` module's `init` function. It's
up to specific modules to handle this configuration.

## Why the name?

This is a *Matrix* bot, coded in Rust and WebAssembly, forming a holy trinity of technologies I
love. And, Trinity is also a bad-ass character from the Matrix movie franchise.
